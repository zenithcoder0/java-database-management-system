Day 0 
Intially had trouble getting things started up. 
I knew that I had to use git commands to get things started but the process of initializing a repo and cloning a repo was confusing. 
Took me awhile to figure out that I was not the correct user that was trying to push code. 
I still don't understand why that was the case but in any case I was able to authenticate with an SSH key.
This works with gitkraken and github terminal

potato potato it works now

Day 1 going to look into do some actual coding...
